# LearningPlayground
Learning C# by myself in order to use Unity, this is a repo where I can keep files that I like and find interesting and may be useful in the future.


If you would like, please suggest some ideas for a game I am coming up with! 

I am using Visual Studio Code as a base software and I am learning from W3School tutorial!

I am also using Codeacademy which is a very good website for beginners!
