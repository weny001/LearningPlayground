Ideas and Concepts


1. Sidescroller platform game where the character runs sideways without an input, but the player can tap and hold to let it grapple to surfaces and swing across gaps.

2. A maze where you have to collect keys, avoid guards, and steal something at the centre, before escaping back through the entrance

Something to do with cars? Idk




I like the first one tbh, can be improved with stuff
